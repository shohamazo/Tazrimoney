/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Tazrimony Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only
 * access their own data, and no data can be accessed without authentication.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, with subcollections for shifts,
 * expenses, budgets, and jobs. This structure ensures clear ownership and
 * simplifies security rules.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly denied to protect user privacy.
 * - All write operations require authentication.
 * - Data consistency between the path and document's internal user ID is enforced.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The data model is designed such that authorization checks do not require
 * additional reads. Each document contains the userId, allowing rules to
 * validate ownership based on the document's content and the request's
 * authentication state.
